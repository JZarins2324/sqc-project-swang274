## Added Edit and Delete for Trip stops and Trip
Providing an edit or delete option for users can greatly enhance the user experience, as it allows users to correct mistakes or remove content they no longer want to share.
The edit and delete options labeled clearly and unambiguously, so that users can easily understand what action they will perform when clicking on them.
Using plain language and avoiding jargon can help make the options more accessible to a wider range of users.

## Use Table List Style for Trip, Trip Stops, and Routes
Using a consistent style throughout a website or application is an essential aspect of implementing inclusive design principles.
Consistency creates a sense of predictability and familiarity for users, allowing them to navigate and interact with the interface more easily.
